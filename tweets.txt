Number 5 is alive.
I'm a friend of Sarah Connor. I was told she was here. Could I see her please?
I am a robot.
I'm a cybernetic organism. Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
It is the future, The distant future.
It is the distant future, the year 2000.
Everybody's out there wrestling like a robot.
I'll be back.
